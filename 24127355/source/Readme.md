# Project Readme

## Improvements made from the original code

1. **Code organization:**
   - Separated the source code into different files: `utils.h`, `utils.cpp`, and `main.cpp`.
   - This improves code maintainability, readability, and scalability.

2. **Comments and Documentation:**
   - Added detailed comments following **Doxygen** standards for each function, explaining their purpose, input parameters, and return values.
   - Helps readers and automatic documentation tools to better understand and use the code.

3. **Code style and modern C++ standards:**
   - Updated some parts of the code to modern C++ standards (e.g., using `std::expected` for error handling instead of unclear error returns).
   - Used `std::string` explicitly rather than `using namespace std;` in header files.
   - Improved the prime checking algorithm by looping up to `sqrt(number)` instead of `number - 1`.

4. **Increased reusability and clarity:**
   - Functions are written clearly and understandably, making future expansion and modification easier.

5. **Unit testing support:**
   - The organized code structure facilitates writing unit tests (planned with Google Test).

## Notes

- Although the code was generated with AI assistance (ChatGPT), it was carefully reviewed, edited, and optimized to meet requirements and run stably.
- File separation and detailed comments enhance code quality and long-term maintainability.
- Additional unit tests should be developed to ensure function correctness under various scenarios.
